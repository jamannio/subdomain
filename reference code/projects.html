            <h2><a href=https://trimm-the-app.vercel.app/index.html class="decrypt-effect">Trimm. The Social Workout App</a></h2>
            <p>People are fat and lonely. Let's change that! :)</p>
            <p>This basically sums up the idea behind Trimm. We had to develop a prototype for a digital product. And after conceptualising the idea, I thought to myself: wait a minute. We're living in the age of AI. How far can I push this?</p>
            <p>The answer is: very far!</p>
            <p>With little experience in web design, I spun up Cursor with Claude as my personal code monkey and built a fully functional progressive web app with the backend on supabase. The app has a small wiki for exercises & nutrition, some social features like making friends or creating challenges, an interactive map with data from OpenStreetMap to find workout spots and, of course, you can track workouts! A fun little project!</p>

            <h2><a href="https://github.com/IshaanShaffir/ToolPool" class="decrypt-effect">ToolPool &#129520;</a></h2>
            <p>During my stay in Canada, I took a course in Human Computer Interaction (HCI). Why should a Data Science student take a UI/UX focused course? Good question.</p>
            <p>But it was a great course! We were assigned to a group and had to realise a project of our choice that benefits the local community in Kelowna. I proposed an idea that I had already some time ago: ToolPool - A local tool sharing platform.</p>
            <p>The idea is simple. Nearly everyone has tools they don't use very often - and on the other hand, we often need tools we don't have. So, why not just lent a tool from a neighbor? We finally get to know each other and maybe I can help them in the garden or with the computer. Bringing people together, reducing waste, giving access to tools for cheap.</p>
            <p>We built a fully functional Android Application. Shoutouts to Ishaan for going crazy on the app! But overall, the whole experience was really cool. Working in a team of strangers, going through all the steps of a design process and finally ending up with the actual application that we've been thinking about for the whole term. Great experience!</p>

            <h2><a href="https://github.com/jamannio/btc_top_bot" class="decrypt-effect">Bitcoin Top Bot</a></h2>
            <p>Being into Bitcoin, you soon realise that there are cycles. In these cycles, the price tends to move extremely to the upside in a short window of time, followed by a sharp decline. I'm not a good trader and missed a lot of gains in the last cylce. But since I know my limitations and have now accrued some Data Science skills, I decided to use my knowledge and coding abilities to create a Telegram Bot that provides me with updates about potentially relevant indicators. The bot is freely available on Telegram (<a href="https://t.me/BitcoinTopBot" target="_blank" class="decrypt-effect">@BitcoinTopBot</a>). Feel free to test it and of course: this is all no financial advice! :P

            <h2>Politricks</h2>
            <p>In the context of a course called Social Informatics of Large Language Models, we examined if state of the art LLMs like GPT-4 can fake German politicians. And long story short: they can. </p>
            <p>We had the OpenDiscourse dataset with about 800 000 speeches from the German parliament. We focused on 24 politicians across all parties and focused on the topics of COVID-19, migration/refugees and the war in Ukraine. Our results showed that this model was able to create speeches that were basically indistinguishable from real speeches. We classified the speeches using MANIFESTOBERTA and speech embeddings with a principal componant analysis. </p>
            <p>Of course, the AI speeches were not perfect. Sometimes they were more extreme than the original speeches of the respective political parties, but overall they did a great job in mimicking the actual politicians.</p>
            <p>Why is that relevant? Well, we're already living in times with hyper-individualised advertising. If LLMs can just create accurate copies or fakes of political speeches, tailored to the audience (which might just be a single person!), than our democracy might become a really big issue. What is the public discourse if we all see differenth things? How can we believe anything we see or read online, when you can create convincing copies easily? And now we also have convincing video generating models. We also have to remember that these models will never be as bad as they are today. Fun times ahead! </p>

            <h2>AI Audiobook</h2>
            <p>A couple of years ago, between finishing my bachelor's and starting my master's program, I helped a friend writing a book. Then, he approached me and told me he wants to publish it as an audiobook. As I've already been working with AI audio generation, I offered him to take care of this. We recorded some test audio where he's reading the book and I used that to create a voice clone. It worked great. The overall costs were about 100$ which is very cheap for a high quality audio book. To be fair, it was not perfect from an accentuation standpoint, but it was clear and an overall pleasant listening experience!<p>
            <p>Sadly, the audibook never got published as he struggled with the regulatory boundaries from the platform he wanted to use. It's sad that not the technical feasibility is the decivise factor, but the ability to navigate regulations. But still an intersting project!</p>

            <h2>From Post Bus to Camper Van</h2>
            <p>This has nothing to do with coding. But building is building. And I do love building!</p>
            <p>Over the summer, I sold my car and got myself an old Post Bus. Bright yellow, no AC, 84 horse powers and a lot of space for ideas. After removing a couple of things like the separation wall between the storage and the passengers' compartment, adding insulation and starting to build a bed with a lot of storage capacity, I ended up with a very nice van, which allows me to go wherever I want, whenever I want. Through my second battery, my turnable passenger bench seat and a flexible table, I can work from anywhere!</p>
            <p>Just need to add Starlink at some point, since the German telecommunication network still sucks in a lot of remote areas. So, if anyone has a spare starlink. Hit me up!&#128029;</p>

            <h2>Voice cloning</h2>
            <p>I'm currently working on creating content with artificial voices. In this field, I've been working with German and English text-to-speech models. From my experience, I can confidently state that you shouldn't trust any voice you hear online. Voice clones are nearly perfect with a lot of trainig data and extremeley good with just a couple of seconds of any voice. Sadly, the open source models can't keep up with the paid models, especially not in German. For the English language, the open-source models are already quite good. But I have to admit that ElevenLabs seems to be state of the art regarding speech capabilities.</p>
            <p>Shoutouts to <a href="https://github.com/thorstenMueller/Thorsten-Voice" class="decrypt-effect"> Thorsten-Voice</a> for providing his voice and doing so much for German Open Source text-to-speech models! </p>

            <h2>KleinanzeiGenAi</h2>
            <p>I love Kleinanzeigen (probably, what non-german people know as online marketplaces), but I hate writing descriptions when selling stuff. So, what is the solution?</p>
            <p>Obviously, a Telegram Bot with an LLM running in the background!</p>
            <p>I decided to work with Claude via the Anthropic API and the results were actually quite good. Just send a few pictures to the bot, optionally, add some keywords. Click "Generate Description" and get a title, price and a nice description for your article in no time.
            <br>Sadly, I couldn't get Selenium to work with the Kleinanzeigen web page, so I couldn't automate the whole process. But still, this little bot was quite helpful. Shoot me a mail, if you're interested in the code!</p>

        <h2><a href="https://github.com/jamannio/Pumpinc" class="decrypt-effect">Pumpinc Bot</a></h2>
        <p>What's better than doing 100 push ups per day?</p>
        <p>Of course doing 100 push ups per day with friends! What started out as some kind of challenge between rommates and friends, where we tracked our daily push ups in a shared spreadsheet, developed into a small coding project. It was the first time for me creating a Telegram Bot, using a SQLite database in the background. Sadly, by the time I was done, we stopped doing our daily 100 push ups. But hey, now I know that I can easily do 100 push ups a day and I know how to create Telegram Bots. I think, you could this a success! </p>

        <h2>Why'ne not</h2>
        <p>One of my first projects a long, long time ago was building an app-based drinking game with a friend. Starting from an idea drawn on a big piece of glass I found in a wardrobe, when I moved into a new flat during my bachelor's. We designed and developed a progressive web app, hosted our game online and played it probably twice. Tbh, a lot of effort, for just a few games. But it was fun! </p>
         <p>Maybe, I should ask my buddy for the code again. Our original website domain also seems to be free. So, maybe there will be a Why'ne not revival at some point! &#127863;</p>
