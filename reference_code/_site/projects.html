            <h2><a href="https://github.com/jamannio/btc_top_bot">Bitcoin Top Bot</a></h2>
            <p>Being into Bitcoin, you soon realise that there are cycles. In these cycles, the price tends to move extremely to the upside in a short window of time, followed by a sharp decline. I'm not a good trader and missed a lot of gains in the last cylce. But since I know my limitations and have now accrued some Data Science skills, I decided to use my knowledge and coding abilities to create a Telegram Bot that provides me with updates about potentially relevant indicators. The bot is freely available on Telegram (<a href="https://t.me/BitcoinTopBot" target="_blank">@BitcoinTopBot</a>). Feel free to test it and of course: this is all no financial advice! :P

            <h2>From Post Bus to Camper Van</h2>
            <p>This has nothing to do with coding. But building is building. And I do love building!</p>
            <p>Over the summer, I sold my car and got myself an old Post Bus. Bright yellow, no AC, 84 horse powers and a lot of space for ideas. After removing a couple of things like the separation wall between the storage and the passengers' compartment, adding insulation and starting to build a bed with a lot of storage capacity, I ended up with a very nice van, which allows me to go wherever I want, whenever I want. Through my second battery, my turnable passenger bench seat and a flexible table, I can work from anywhere!</p>
            <p>Just need to add Starlink at some point, since the German telecommunication network still sucks in a lot of remote areas. So, if anyone has a spare starlink. Hit me up!&#128029;</p>

            <h2>Voice cloning</h2>
            <p>I'm currently working on creating content with artificial voices. In this field, I've been working with German and English text-to-speech models. From my experience, I can confidently state that you shouldn't trust any voice you hear online. Voice clones are nearly perfect with a lot of trainig data and extremeley good with just a couple of seconds of any voice. Sadly, the open source models can't keep up with the paid models, especially not in German. For the English language, the open-source models are already quite good. But I have to admit that ElevenLabs seems to be state of the art regarding speech capabilities.</p>
            <p>Shoutouts to <a href="https://github.com/thorstenMueller/Thorsten-Voice"> Thorsten-Voice</a> for providing his voice and doing so much for German Open Source text-to-speech models! </p>

            <h2>KleinanzeiGenAi</h2>
            <p>I love Kleinanzeigen (probably, what non-german people know as online marketplaces), but I hate writing descriptions when selling stuff. So, what is the solution?</p>
            <p>Obviously, a Telegram Bot with an LLM running in the background!</p>
            <p>I decided to work with Claude via the Anthropic API and the results were actually quite good. Just send a few pictures to the bot, optionally, add some keywords. Click "Generate Description" and get a title, price and a nice description for your article in no time.
            <br>Sadly, I couldn't get Selenium to work with the Kleinanzeigen web page, so I couldn't automate the whole process. But still, this little bot was quite helpful. Shoot me a mail, if you're interested in the code!</p>

        <p>What's better than doing 100 push ups per day?</p>
        <p>Of course doing 100 push ups per day with friends! What started out as some kind of challenge between rommates and friends, where we tracked our daily push ups in a shared spreadsheet, developed into a small coding project. It was the first time for me creating a Telegram Bot, using a SQLite database in the background. Sadly, by the time I was done, we stopped doing our daily 100 push ups. But hey, now I know that I can easily do 100 push ups a day and I know how to create Telegram Bots. I think, you could this a success! </p>

        <h2>Why'ne not</h2>
        <p>One of my first projects a long, long time ago was building an app-based drinking game with a friend. Starting from an idea drawn on a big piece of glass I found in a wardrobe, when I moved into a new flat during my bachelor's. We designed and developed a progressive web app, hosted our game online and played it probably twice. Tbh, a lot of effort, for just a few games. But it was fun! </p>
         <p>Maybe, I should ask my buddy for the code again. Our original website domain also seems to be free. So, maybe there will be a Why'ne not revival at some point! &#127863;</p>
